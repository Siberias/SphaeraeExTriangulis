# SphaeraeExTriangulis
A basic game/test application for the CryoStar Engine

##Getting started

###Tools needed
* Visual Studio 2015 (Compatible with [Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx))

###Libraries needed
* [CryoStar Engine](https://github.com/Siberias/CryoStarEngine)

###Setup steps

1. Clone the project as well as the CryoStar engine project
2. Make sure that both projects have the same root directory
   i.e.
   ParentFolder
     -CryoStarEngine
       -Source
       -CyroStarEngine.sln
       -...
    -SphaeraeExTriangulis
       -Source
       -SphaeraeExTriangulis.sln
       -...
       
3. Open up SphaeraeExTriangulis.sln and run the project

## What's with the name
I wanted to name this after a Brown Dwarf star to tie into the naming of CryoStar, but all the Brown Dwarfs have very scientific names like HD 13189 b
So I took the name of a constellation containing a Brown Dwarf, 'Triangulum' and then thought of referencing that games create objects out of triangles. 
A sphere made of triangles could represent a Star and therefore I settled on SphearaeExTriangulum - A Sphere of Triangles

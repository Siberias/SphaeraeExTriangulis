# SphaeraeExTriangulis
A basic game/test application for the CryoStar Engine

## Getting started

### Tools needed
* Visual Studio 2015 (Compatible with [Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx))
* Git (Using the Git integration for Visual Studio 2015 is recommended)

### Libraries needed
* [CryoStar Engine](https://github.com/Siberias/CryoStarEngine)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the project as well as the CryoStar engine project
2. Make sure that both projects have the same root directory
   
   e.g.
   ```
   ParentFolder
     -CryoStarEngine
       -Source
       -CyroStarEngine.sln
       -...
    -SphaeraeExTriangulis
       -Source
       -SphaeraeExTriangulis.sln
       -...
   ```
       
3. Open the SphaeraeExTriangulis.sln solution file in Visual Studio
4. Compile and run the project

## What's with the name?
I wanted to name this after a Brown Dwarf star to tie into the naming of CryoStar, but all the Brown Dwarfs have very scientific names like HD 13189 b

So I took the name of a constellation containing a Brown Dwarf, 'Triangulum' and then thought about how games create objects out of triangles.

A sphere made of triangles could represent a Star and therefore I settled on SphearaeExTriangulis - A Sphere of Triangles.

Lastly, 'triangulum' changed to 'triangulis' as I preferred the sound of it.
